### Sutton SignWriting Fonts
The Sutton SignWriting TrueType fonts are available for download and installation.

Installing the fonts using the instructions below is not required, but it will improve the user experience.
If the fonts are not installed on the system, CSS declarations will install the fonts in the browser cache.  

The Sutton SignWriting Line font and the Sutton SignWriting Fill font have been tailored for SVG.
The Sutton SignWriting 1D Optimal font and the Sutton SignWriting 1D font are useful in standard 1D text fields.
The Sutton Signwriting 2D Optimal font and the Sutton SignWriting 2D font are currently in development.
