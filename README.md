The Sutton SignWriting project is designed for the internet community and includes TrueType Fonts, Scalar Vector Graphics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Functions.
The Formal SignWriting specification is a faithful encoding of Sutton SignWriting that is documented in an Internet Draft submitted to the IETF.

### Sutton SignWriting Fonts
The Sutton SignWriting TrueType fonts are available for download and installation.

Installing the fonts using the instructions below is not required, but it will improve the user experience.
If the fonts are not installed on the system, CSS declarations will install the fonts in the browser cache.

### Sutton SignWriting JavaScript Libraries

Simply include a Sutton SignWriting JavaScript file in any HTML page to access the functions.
